Rooms at The Castle is a room booking website designed to advertise rooms in a pub in the Devonshire countryside to potential customers. Customers are able to learn about the pub's location and history as well as view the individual rooms on offer. In order to make a booking they must then sign up to the website.

# Technologies Used

## Languages, Frameworks and Packages

The site was developed using a Django framework, with Python being the primary backend language. JavaScript was used for the calendar functionality and HTML was used alongside the Django template language to display data in the frontend. I used CSS and employed Bootstrap classes to style the website alongside some JavaScript for dynamic styling.
